George Brown College is a public college of applied arts and technology with three campuses in downtown Toronto.
The three campuses are St. James Campus located near the St. James Cathedral Church, 
Casa Loma Campus located near Casa Loma, and Waterfront Campus.
George Brown College has a good student insurence plan that covers 
most dental fees and has althelic therapy available on compus.
I rolled over my ankle twice in September and was able to get help from school's athletic therapist for free of charge.
The therapist was very nice and profesional, I was really glad when I found out about this benefit.
